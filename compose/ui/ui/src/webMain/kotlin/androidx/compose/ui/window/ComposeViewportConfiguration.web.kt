     * such as `WindowInsets.safeDrawing`, `WindowInsets.ime`, etc.
     *
     * When set to `true`, the scene reads safe area insets from the browser using CSS
     * `env(safe-area-inset-*)` environment variables, and tracks IME (virtual keyboard) geometry.
     *
     * **Prerequisite**: the page must opt in to edge-to-edge rendering by including
     * `viewport-fit=cover` in the viewport meta tag:
     * ```html
     * <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
     * ```
     * Without `viewport-fit=cover`, the browser applies safe area padding automatically and all
     * `env(safe-area-inset-*)` variables return `0px`, so insets will always be zero.
     *
     * By default, this is `false` and the scene reports zero insets.
     *
     * **Scrollable containers:** insets are re-read on `window resize` and keyboard geometry events,
     * but not on page scroll. If the [composeScene] is inside a scrollable page, its viewport position
     * changes as the user scrolls, so the insets may become invalid. In that case
     * it is recommended to disable inset handling entirely (`enableBrowserWindowInsets = false`) and
     * manage padding manually.
